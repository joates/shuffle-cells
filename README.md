more efficient version of [scatter-cells](https://github.com/joates/scatter-cells)

Here is the live [demo](http://joat.es/webgl/shuffle-cells)

#### Note
The ```three-r65.js``` file that is required in the source files is _not included_ in the repo, to create it you simply edit your standard [three.min.js](https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/tree/master/build) file and add ```module.exports = THREE``` to the end of the file.
